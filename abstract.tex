In this paper we describe how we have implemented remote function calls in the
HPX library for task-based multithreaded distributed C++ applications targeting
both HPC and conventional users.
The use of strongly typed syntax and template techniques available in the language 
allows the compiler to perform transformations on the user's code that enable 
high performance serialization of functions and their arguments, 
reduction of memory copies between user code and the network layer, 
and the integration of RMA semantics; all within a simple, expressive and unified API.
We demonstrate the utility and performance of our implementation with benchmarks
and integration into an astrophysics simulation on a large supercomputer.
